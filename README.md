# RandomMazeGenerator
Theo Landeggar and I made this together April 2014 for a school project.

Generates random mazes with the given dimensions using Kruskal's Algorithm. Visually solves the maze with both breadth first and depth first search. We also added an option to allow the user to solve the maze themselves via the arrow keys. Correct path is highlighted once completed.
